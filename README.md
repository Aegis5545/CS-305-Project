# CS-305-Project
For this Project, Artemis Financial reached out for help with their software vulnerabilities to boost security and protect sensitive financial information. To tackle this, I focused on improving input validation, setting up proper error handling, and using SHA-256 for cryptographic security. These steps were key in reducing risks like injection attacks and data breaches. By following best practices, I ensured secure communication through HTTPS, which enhanced data integrity and built trust. The journey of finding and fixing vulnerabilities was tough but fulfilling, as it demanded a solid grasp of secure coding techniques. Moving forward, I plan to use tools like static code analysis and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities and apply the right fixes based on how serious the threats are. I also made sure to double-check the code's functionality and security through additional testing, ensuring that no new vulnerabilities popped up during the refactoring. This experience will be super helpful for future projects, showcasing my skills in securing applications, fixing security issues, and helping to keep sensitive systems safe.
